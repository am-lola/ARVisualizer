# am2b-ar

An augmented-reality visualization library

## Usage

The visualizer supports some keyboard shortcuts which can be applied to any visualization instance:

    '1' : Render meshes as shaded Triangles (default)
    '2' : Render meshes as wireframes
    '3' : Render meshes as points (one point per vertex)

# Dependencies

To compile the library, you just need [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/) (which you can apt-get install) and [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org/) (which you might need to build from source depending on your platform).

To compile the samples, you will also need PCL: http://pointclouds.org/
