# am2b-ar

An augmented-reality visualization library

# Dependencies

To compile the library, you just need [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/) (which you can apt-get install) and [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org/) (which you might need to build from source depending on your platform).

To compile the samples, you will also need PCL: http://pointclouds.org/
